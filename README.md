# RISC-Processor

Description
-
- A simple RISC processor developed in Verilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA in Computer Engineering 211. <br>
- It is a 16-bit CPU that supports arithmetic operations, load & store, and branch conditions.

What I learned
- Designing a state machine that supports instruction fetch, decode, execution, and writeback stages
- Writing testbenches in verilog and running them on ModelSim
- Using Quartus Prime to analyse and compile digital logic created by the Verilog code
